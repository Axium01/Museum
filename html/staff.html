                    <h2>Dr. Amina Torres</h2>
                    <p><strong>Archaeologist specializing in Bronze Age Mediterranean and Near Eastern artifacts (metalwork, ceramics, and domestic architecture).</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Professional Bio: </strong>Dr. Amina Torres holds a PhD in Archaeology from the University of Barcelona under the supervision of Dr. Isabel Romero. With over a decade of field experience, she has excavated and researched Bronze Age sites across the Aegean, Levant, and Iberian Peninsula. 
                    Amina focuses on the cultural and technological networks that connected early Mediterranean societies through trade, craftsmanship, and ritual practice.
                    She is skilled in 3D artifact scanning, compositional analysis of metals and clays, and the use of GIS and drone imaging for site documentation. Her fieldwork integrates environmental data with artifact study to reconstruct how ancient communities adapted to climate and geography.</p>
                    <p><strong>Role: </strong>She directs Bronze Age excavation projects and oversees the cataloging, conservation, and display of recovered artifacts for the museum’s permanent collection.</p>

                    <h2>Dr. Sienna Ward</h2>
                    <p><strong>Cultural Anthropologist specializing in Bronze Age ritual systems, social stratification, and belief expression through material and performative culture.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Professional Bio: </strong> Dr. Sienna Ward earned her PhD in Anthropology from the University of Edinburgh, where her dissertation explored the intersection of religion, identity, and landscape in Bronze Age Anatolia. 
                    Over the past fifteen years, she has conducted ethnographic and comparative research on ritual practices, kinship structures, and symbolic art in early agrarian societies.
                    Sienna’s work bridges prehistoric anthropology and modern ethnography. She investigates how myth, ceremony, and craft functioned as tools for community cohesion and social order. 
                    Using comparative ethnology and symbolic theory, she reconstructs how Bronze Age peoples may have understood the sacred and the everyday.</p>

                    <h2>Dr. Elias Morgan</h2>
                    <p><strong>Archaeologist and Cultural Anthropologist – Bronze Age Societies</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Professional Bio: </strong>Dr. Elias Morgan earned his doctorate in Archaeology and Anthropology from the University of Cambridge, with a focus on Bronze Age civilizations across the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East. 
                    His research explores patterns of trade, technology, and ritual expression in early complex societies.
                    Elias specializes in reconstructing daily life through the study of material culture—metalwork, ceramics, textiles, and funerary architecture—and in interpreting how belief systems shaped social organization.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interpretive Method: </strong>Combines stratigraphic data, cross-cultural analysis, experimental archaeology, and ethnographic analogy to reconstruct behavior, ritual, and craft production. 
                    Employs digital modeling, GIS mapping, and interactive displays to translate archaeological evidence into lived experience.</p>
