                    data-modal-target="#modal-text-stylus" width="50%">
                <p>This slender bronze stylus, approximately 18 cm long and 1 cm in diameter, features a tapered point
                    at one end for inscribing soft clay or wax and a flattened spatula at the other, weighing roughly
                    120 g. Traces of corrosion indicate long-term burial, while grooves and wear along the tip show it
                    was actively used to write. It was recovered from the scribal quarter near the palace archives at
                    Ugarit, in a collapsed storage room filled with administrative debris. Fragmented clay tablets and
                    ceramic inkwells found nearby suggest it was part of a professional scribe’s toolkit.

                    Styluses like this were essential in recording trade, taxation, and ritual matters, demonstrating
                    the literacy and bureaucratic sophistication of Late Bronze Age city-states. Similar examples have
                    been found at Hattusa and Byblos, highlighting widespread scribal practices across the Eastern
                    Mediterranean. Clay residue preserved in the grooves offers direct evidence of the tool’s practical
                    function, while the form reflects careful design optimized for both inscription and erasure.

                    Through its physical characteristics and archaeological context, this stylus illuminates the
                    material culture of literacy, showing how writing technology shaped administration and
                    communication. It embodies both the daily work of scribes and the broader social networks of trade
                    and governance, providing insight into how Bronze Age societies structured information, labor, and
                    ritual practices. This object bridges the gap between technological skill and societal organization,
                    revealing the human effort behind the creation and maintenance of early record-keeping systems.

                    class="open-modal" data-modal-target="#modal-text-tablet" width="50%">
                <p>This rectangular fragment of baked clay, approximately 12 × 8 × 2 cm and weighing 350 g, preserves a
                    portion of cuneiform writing, the wedge-shaped script used throughout Mesopotamia. The tablet may
                    have served as an administrative record, possibly tracking grain distribution or ration lists,
                    reflecting the complex economic organization of Kassite-period city-states. Uneven firing indicates
                    it was initially sun-dried before accidental baking, a method consistent with the mass production of
                    bureaucratic documents.

                    Formed by hand and smoothed with a reed, the clay was incised using a stylus, which left clear
                    impressions of the cuneiform wedges. Fragments of other tablets, broken jar seals, and carbonized
                    seeds were found nearby, suggesting the tablet was part of a larger archive within a temple
                    storehouse. Comparable administrative tablets from Ur and Babylon demonstrate similar handwriting,
                    format, and accounting practices.

                    Through this fragment, we glimpse the rise of written administration and economic control in early
                    urban Mesopotamia. Tablets like this enabled officials to monitor resources, manage labor, and
                    coordinate trade across cities. Though incomplete, the artifact communicates the practical, everyday
                    use of writing as a tool of governance, while also highlighting the skilled craftsmanship involved
                    in preparing clay and inscribing legible text. This fragment offers both a material and social
                    window into Bronze Age bureaucracy, showing how written records structured society, supported ritual
                    institutions, and reinforced political authority.

                    data-modal-target="#modal-text-dagger" width="50%">
                <p>This elegant bronze dagger was placed beside a burial in a stone-lined chamber near Mycenae.
                    Measuring 28 cm in length with a leaf-shaped blade and a carved bone handle secured by copper
                    rivets, the weapon exemplifies the mastery of Middle Bronze Age metalworkers. The blade’s fine
                    polish and slight edge wear suggest limited use before interment, implying that the dagger served
                    primarily as a ceremonial or status object rather than a tool of combat.

                    Its inclusion in the grave, together with gold beads, small ceramic vessels, and animal bone
                    fragments, points to funerary rituals that combined personal prestige with offerings to the
                    afterlife. Such associations evoke the symbolic dimensions of weaponry in Bronze Age society—objects
                    that mediated between power, identity, and remembrance.

                    Comparable examples from the Mycenaean Shaft Graves and the Cyclades reveal a shared aesthetic and
                    technological vocabulary across the Aegean. In these contexts, daggers functioned as emblems of rank
                    and masculine virtue, bridging the worlds of craftsmanship and ceremony.

                    Through digital modeling and experimental reconstruction, archaeologists have replicated the
                    dagger’s casting process, illuminating the sequence of mold preparation, alloying, and finishing
                    that produced such gleaming instruments of prestige. The artifact’s preservation—light corrosion on
                    the blade, intact yet cracked handle—offers a rare glimpse into the material life of an object
                    designed to endure both time and memory.

                    Today, this dagger invites reflection on the Bronze Age fusion of art, technology, and ritual,
                    embodying a world where the making of metal was as much a spiritual act as a display of skill.

                <img src="../images/collections/garment.jpg" alt="Fragment of Woven Linen Tunic" class="artifact-img"
                    class="open-modal" data-modal-target="#modal-text-garment" width="50%">
                <p>This surviving fragment of a linen tunic measures approximately 35 × 22 cm and weighs an estimated
                    60 g when intact. Hand-spun flax fibers, woven on a horizontal loom, form a tight, consistent
                    pattern, while traces of vegetal dyes suggest the garment was originally colored with madder root
                    and woad. The edges are frayed, and discoloration and thread thinning indicate wear from repeated
                    use, but the central weave remains well preserved due to the arid burial conditions.

                    The tunic was discovered wrapped around human remains in a simple pit burial, likely serving both as
                    a domestic garment and as funerary wrapping, a practice common in middle-class Bronze Age
                    households. Found alongside faience beads, pottery fragments, and spindle whorls, the fragment
                    provides insight into everyday life and gendered labor systems, as textile production was often a
                    domestic craft managed by women. Comparable textiles from Kahun and Tell el-Dab‘a exhibit similar
                    weaving density and fiber preparation, suggesting shared techniques across contemporary Egyptian
                    communities.

                    This fragment reflects the integration of craft, daily life, and mortuary practice in Bronze Age
                    Egypt. The tunic represents not only clothing but also the labor, skill, and resources invested in
                    textile production, linking household activities to broader social and cultural frameworks. Its
                    preservation allows us to visualize the clothing, color, and texture of Middle Bronze Age garments,
                    offering a tangible connection to the people who made and wore them.

                <img src="../images/collections/figurine.jpg" alt="Terracotta Figurine" class="artifact-img"
                    class="open-modal" data-modal-target="#modal-text-figurine" width="50%">
                <p>This small terracotta figure, only 17 centimeters tall, was recovered from a domestic hearth deposit
                    at the later phase of Çatalhöyük—one of the most enduring settlements of ancient Anatolia. Modeled
                    entirely by hand from fine-grained clay, the figure was finished with a red slip and decorated
                    post-firing with black and white mineral pigments. Microscopic analysis reveals multiple layers of
                    repainting, suggesting that it remained in use over an extended period, perhaps renewed during
                    recurring domestic or seasonal rituals.

                    The figurine’s hollowed lower body lightened its weight and aided drying during firing, while
                    fingerprint impressions preserved on its surface provide a tangible link to the individual who
                    shaped it. Found with loom weights, small bowls, and charred cereal remains, the piece likely played
                    a role in household rituals tied to fertility, protection, or remembrance of ancestors.

                    Its form embodies the feminine principle common across early agrarian societies, where household
                    prosperity and generative power were personified through female imagery. Comparable anthropomorphic
                    figures from the Cyclades and the Levant indicate shared ritual themes and aesthetic conventions
                    across the wider Eastern Mediterranean.

                    Although its precise function cannot be known with certainty, the figurine materializes a social
                    world in which domestic life, craft, and ritual were inseparable. Through digital modeling and
                    pigment analysis, archaeologists can now restore its original coloration—revealing not only a sacred
                    image, but the gestures, repetitions, and beliefs that animated Bronze Age households.

            <img src="../images/collections/skull.jpg" alt="Human Skull with Dentition" class="artifact-img" class="open-modal"
                data-modal-target="#modal-text-skull" width="50%">
            <p>This human skull, discovered in a secluded cave burial in the Zagros Mountains, bears powerful testimony
                to Bronze Age practices of bodily transformation and remembrance. Measuring approximately 22 cm in
                diameter, the cranium and teeth show deliberate alterations: the front incisors are notched and inlaid
                with dark mineral pigment, possibly hematite or manganese, applied using fine abrasives. These
                modifications were unlikely functional; instead, they likely communicated social identity, group
                affiliation, or ritualized status.

                The skull was found placed apart from other skeletal remains within a small collective burial. This
                separation suggests intentional treatment as a curated relic—perhaps an ancestral head preserved for
                ceremonial display or periodic veneration. Nearby artifacts—bead necklaces, a bronze awl, and animal
                bones from ritual feasting—point to funerary offerings uniting memory, community, and sustenance.

                Microscopic examination of the cranial surface reveals faint cut marks, indicating careful postmortem
                preparation rather than violence. Comparative analysis with mortuary traditions in Central Asian and
                Eurasian pastoralist groups reveals a shared symbolic logic: the human body as a living medium for
                expressing belonging, lineage, and the sacred.

                By employing digital scanning and pigment analysis, archaeologists are reconstructing how the notched
                and pigmented teeth may have appeared when viewed in life or ritual light. Such reconstructions
                transform this artifact from a static relic into a vivid reminder of how Bronze Age communities
                inscribed social meaning directly onto the body—creating enduring connections between identity,
                ancestry, and belief.

            <h2 id="modal-title">Bronze Stylus</h2>
            <h3>Late Bronze Age, c. 1200–1000 BCE | Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra, Syria)</h3>
            <p>
                This bronze stylus, approximately 18 cm long, was used to inscribe cuneiform or alphabetic script onto
                soft clay or wax tablets. Its tapered point and flattened spatula show wear along the tip and edges, and
                traces of clay remain in the grooves, revealing frequent use.

                Found in the debris of a collapsed storage room near palace archives, alongside fragmented tablets and
                ceramic inkwells, the stylus reflects the bureaucratic life of Ugarit’s scribes. Similar tools from
                Hattusa and Byblos indicate regional patterns of literacy and administrative practice during the Late
                Bronze Age.

                Through humanistic-material culture analysis, this stylus helps us understand both the practical craft
                of writing and the social role of literacy in early city-states. While we cannot know the exact texts it
                recorded, the artifact embodies the skilled labor, governance, and cultural importance of communication
                in Bronze Age society.

            <h2 id="modal-title">Clay Tablet Fragment</h2>
            <h3>Late Bronze Age, Kassite Period, c. 1300–1100 BCE | Nippur, Iraq</h3>
            <p>This rectangular clay fragment (approx. 12 × 8 × 2 cm, 350 g) bears legible cuneiform inscriptions and
                shows minor edge erosion. Uneven firing suggests it was sun-dried before accidental baking, a technique
                consistent with mass-produced administrative documents. Found in a temple storehouse archive alongside
                other tablet fragments, jar seals, and carbonized seeds, it likely recorded grain inventories or
                rations, reflecting the organization of labor and resources in Kassite urban society.

                Its shape, handwriting style, and manufacture match standardized bureaucratic tablets from Ur and
                Babylon, demonstrating shared administrative practices across Mesopotamia. Hand-formed and smoothed with
                a reed, the fragment was inscribed with a stylus, providing insight into the daily work of scribes.

                Viewed through a humanistic–material culture lens, this tablet illustrates both the practical techniques
                of record-keeping and the broader social and economic role of literacy, showing how writing structured
                governance, labor, and ritual in Bronze Age Mesopotamian city-states.

            <h3>Middle Bronze Age, c. 1800–1500 BCE | Found near Mycenae, Greece</h3>
            <p>Excavated from a burial mound near Mycenae, this bronze dagger reveals the artistry and symbolism of
                Middle Bronze Age Greece. Its cast bronze blade, bone handle, and copper rivets show sophisticated metal
                and bone working techniques. At 28 cm long, the dagger’s triangular, leaf-shaped form balances function
                and ornament.

                Minor edge wear suggests limited use before burial, pointing to its role as a ceremonial or status
                object rather than a weapon of war. Found beside human remains with gold beads and ceramic vessels, it
                likely marked the high rank or identity of its owner—perhaps an elite warrior or chieftain. Similar
                pieces from Mycenae’s Shaft Graves reflect shared traditions of prestige and power across the Aegean.

                Today, the dagger endures as a testament to craftsmanship, social hierarchy, and the ritual language of
                metal in early Mycenaean society.</p>

            <h3>Middle Bronze Age, c. 1900–1600 BCE | Deir el-Ballas, Upper Egypt</h3>
            <p>This fragment of hand-spun linen (approx. 35 × 22 cm, 60 g) was likely part of an everyday garment from a
                middle-class household. Faded vegetal dyes from madder root and woad, along with thread thinning and
                frayed edges, indicate extended wear and repeated washing. Eventually, the textile was repurposed as
                funerary wrapping, found around human remains in a simple pit burial.

                Microscopic analysis shows it was woven on a horizontal loom with consistent thread spacing, reflecting
                domestic weaving skill. Similar linen textiles from Kahun and Tell el-Dab‘a suggest shared techniques in
                fiber preparation, weaving, and dyeing across Middle Bronze Age Egypt.

                Found alongside faience beads, pottery fragments, and spindle whorls, the fragment illustrates the
                integration of textile production into household labor and gendered craft systems. Through a
                humanistic-material culture perspective, the tunic fragment conveys both practical and social aspects of
                daily life, revealing how ordinary clothing was connected to identity, skill, and ritual in Bronze Age
                society.

            <h3>Early Bronze Age, c. 2500–2000 BCE | Çatalhöyük (later phase), Central Anatolia</h3>
            <p>This finely crafted terracotta figure, standing 17 cm tall, was found in a domestic hearth deposit at
                Çatalhöyük. Modeled by hand from fine clay and painted with red slip and mineral pigments, the figurine
                was likely used in household rituals related to fertility, protection, or ancestor veneration.

                Fingerprint impressions preserved in the clay and traces of layered repainting connect the object to
                repeated acts of care and renewal. Found alongside loom weights, small bowls, and carbonized cereal
                remains, it evokes a world in which domestic labor and spiritual practice were intertwined.

                Comparable figures from the Cyclades and the Levant point to shared Bronze Age traditions celebrating
                feminine generative power. Despite its fragile form, the figurine endures as a material expression of

            <h3>Late Bronze Age, c. 1300–1100 BCE | Zagros Mountains, western Iran</h3>
            <p>Excavated from a cave burial near the Zagros Mountains, this Late Bronze Age skull reveals the deep
                interconnection between body, belief, and identity. The teeth display deliberate notching and inlays of
                dark mineral pigment—likely hematite or manganese—applied using fine abrasive tools. Such modifications
                probably signified clan membership or elevated social status rather than serving a practical function.

                Found separately from other skeletons, the skull appears to have been a curated ancestral relic.
                Associated offerings—bead necklaces, a bronze awl, and animal bones from ritual feasting—suggest
                ceremonies of remembrance and renewal.

                Through 3D modeling and pigment analysis, archaeologists reconstruct how these modifications may have
                appeared in life, illuminating ancient traditions in which the human body itself became a vessel of
                identity and spiritual continuity.</p>
